# Explicit Permission Rules

- **DO NOT ADD TO ARCHIVES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**: Never add any content to the archives unless the user explicitly says to add it.
- **EXPLICIT PERMISSION PHRASES**: Only add content when the user clearly says phrases like \"add this to archives\", \"save this in archives\", or \"document this in archives\".
- **WHEN IN DOUBT, ASK**: If unsure whether the user wants something added to archives, ask for confirmation first rather than adding automatically.
